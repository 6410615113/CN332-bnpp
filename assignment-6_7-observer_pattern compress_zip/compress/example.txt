To run the application, you need to compile the Java files and then execute the compiled program. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Compile Java Files:**

   Assuming you have saved all the Java files in a directory, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to that directory.

   Compile all Java files using the `javac` command. For example:
   ```
   javac -d . algorithms/*.java
   javac -d . commands/*.java
   javac -d . factories/*.java
   javac -d . main/*.java
   ```

   This command compiles all `.java` files in the current directory and its subdirectories and stores the compiled `.class` files in the current directory.

2. **Run the Application:**

   After compiling the Java files, you can run the `CommandLineParser` class by specifying the required command-line arguments. Here's the general syntax:

   ```
   java main.CommandLineParser <inputFile> <-compressionAlgorithm> <-encryptionAlgorithm> <-checksumAlgorithm>
   ```

   Replace `<inputFile>` with the path to the file you want to process, `<compressionAlgorithm>` with the desired compression algorithm (e.g., `-zip`), `<encryptionAlgorithm>` with the desired encryption algorithm (e.g., `-DES`), and `<checksumAlgorithm>` with the desired checksum algorithm (e.g., `-MD5`).

   For example, if you want to compress, encrypt, and compute MD5 checksum for a file named `example.txt`, you can run the following command:

   ```
   java main.CommandLineParser example.txt -zip -DES -MD5
   ```

   This command will execute the application with the specified input file and algorithms.

3. **View Output:**

   Depending on the implementation of the commands, the application may produce output files with modified versions of the input file (e.g., compressed file, encrypted file, checksum file). You can check the generated files to verify the results.
